Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
  Answer: The number of iterations would take 7. Since G is the 7th letter and linear search typically runs through the entire dataset looking
  for a match.

Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
  Answer: The number of iterations using a binary sort to find G would take 3.

Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.
  Answer: fib(10) = 55, fib(11) = 89, fib(12) = 144

Compare the time it takes to run fib(20) between the iterative solution from the previous checkpoint and recursive solutions.

    Iterative is FASTER!?


Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search?
Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
  For an unsorted collection, you really don't have much of a choice. Binary Search is only available for SORTED array.
  You couldn't really use it for a unsorted collection.

  Given the size of the array (a million items) we have already shown that recursion can be fairly expensive when it comes
  to time efficiencies. Therefore we would choose iterative as opposed to recursive.


Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search?
Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
  For a sorted collection, you would definitely want to use a Binary Search method as opposed to linear. Binary Search
  can cut down the search times. Worst case O(n) for linear and O(Log n) for Binary.

  Again, given the size of the array we would still want to use iterative as opposed to recursive based on the earlier
  findings when we benchmarked the two.
