Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.

There are a few reasons why doubling the size of the underlying array might be
a poor choice for a hash. First, doubling the size of the array is a slow
operation, since it requires accessing memory. Also once the array is doubled,
the program needs to recalculate the location of each item inside the hash.
Another reason is space, doubling the size of an array effectively requires
the computer to double the amount of memory allocated to the hash, taking up
a large amount of memory blocks for array objects which are waiting to be filled.
