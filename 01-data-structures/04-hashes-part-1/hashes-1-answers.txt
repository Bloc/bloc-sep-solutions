  In order to deal with collisions, this checkpoint instructed us to double the
length of the array and re-map the keys with a new array size.  This made it
relatively simple to fix collisions.

  Although this is an easy way to deal with collisions it is not the most effective.
There are a couple things to consider about this option and why it may not be
the best.  As you double the size of larger arrays they grow faster and faster,
potentially taking up too much space.  This process is also allocating memory
which is not a quick process.  In addition if collisions are happening frequently
the items in your array may be very spaced out within that array wasting all the space
in between, which would not be very efficient.

  While doubling the size of an array may work in certain scenarios there are
definitely better solutions to this problem, such as the expansion method described
in the checkpoint (increasing to a prime number near the next largest power of two).
