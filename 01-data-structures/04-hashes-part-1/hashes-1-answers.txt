Doubling the size of the array causes the computer to allocate a lot of memory to perform this function, thus slowing everything else down. When the array is doubled, there are twice as many elements to be searched that would theoretically take twice as long. As the arrays increase in size, the amount of RAM used would be increased exponentially. Each time an array is doubled in size, all elements are repositioned in the new array which can also be very memory intensive.
