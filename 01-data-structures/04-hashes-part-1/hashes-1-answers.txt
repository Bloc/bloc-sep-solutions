Q: Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.
  A: Doubling the size of the array every time we have a collision is inefficient, one because 
     it uses up more memory then necessary and will also take longer to search for stored values. 
     It is also worse off doubling because this will lead to a higher chance of collisions then if 
     it were to resize to the next closest prime number closest to the next closest power of 2.
