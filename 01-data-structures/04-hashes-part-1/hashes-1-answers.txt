Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a
poor idea.

  Doubling the array size every time there is a collision may not be the best way
  of solving this issue. If we remember that arrays are awesome at accessing information
  as long as we know the index, but when we double the array size all the existing data
  has to be copied into the new larger array. This is a costly processing operation.

  In addition, every time we double an array we increase the number of empty slots
  which by definition we are creating fragmentation and not being very memory allocation-
  sensitive.

  Arrays are also kept in the same memory blocks too. Meaning if the array expands, and
  there isn't enough room, the memory manager will look for other blocks that can
  accommodate the new size. This is also a costly operation.
