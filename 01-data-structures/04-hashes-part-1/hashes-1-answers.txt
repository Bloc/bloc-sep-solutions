1.Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.
Ans: It's because it may lead to longer time of search for the designated value, and creating an array is quite wasting of memory and time consumption. It will be even slower if the size is not the power of 2. Finally, double the size of the array may easily lead to the same hash result since new size is divisible by old size.
