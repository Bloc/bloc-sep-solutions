The process of doubling the size of the underlying array of my HashClass may be a poor idea due to the fragmentation and performance issues that may result as the array grows in length.

Each time we resize and double the array we are introducing more empty/open slots which not only utilizes more memory, but also increases array search time. Again, these performance issues will gain in severity as the array grows in size.
