Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.
  Hints:
  Doubling the size of the area increased the number of open slots in the array for potential values which may lead to more fragmentation.
  Doubling the size of an array (allocating memory) is a slow operation.

Doubling the size of the array, may be unnecessary in some cases. For example, here we are doubling the size of the array when there is a collision for hash_items with the same kay but different values. Why double which requires more memory when you can just overwite the current value.

Also, a doubling function grows very quickly. This means you can quickly require a very large internal array which requires more memory. Doubling will grow much faster than increasing to a prime number near the next largest power of two.
