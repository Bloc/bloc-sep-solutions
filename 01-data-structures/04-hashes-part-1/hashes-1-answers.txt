  In order to deal with collisions, this checkpoint instructed us to double the
length of the array and re-map the keys with the new array size.  This made it
relatively simple to fix collisions.

  Although this is an easy way to deal with collisions it is not the most effective.
There are a couple things to consider about this option and why it may not be
the best.  As you double the size of arrays they will grow faster and faster,
potentially taking up too much space.  This process also requires allocating more
memory which is not a quick task.  In addition if collisions are happening 
frequently the array is doubling making it so items in your array are more spaced
out, leaving a lot of nil values in the array and wasting space, which would not be very
efficient.

  While doubling the size of an array may work in certain scenarios there are
definitely better solutions to this problem, such as the expansion method described
in the checkpoint (increasing to a prime number near the next largest power of two).
