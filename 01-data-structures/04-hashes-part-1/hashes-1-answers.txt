Question: Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor
idea.

Answer: Doubling may lead to more fragmentation due to the exponential growth as the
size of the array increase. It will also require allocating more memory which decreases performance
by slowing the system down. Recall that the entire array may need to be traversed to search for data.
This becomes incredibly inefficient considering that the data is constantly relocating as the array
resizes.
