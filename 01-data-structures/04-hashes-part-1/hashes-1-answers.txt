1. Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.

    Doubling the size of the array every time there is a conflict would easily cause the
    array to grow to substantial sizes very quickly.  With the example provided, only
    6 elements added caused the array to grow from size 6 to 24, so if you had 1,000 
    elements, the array could easily be very large and have a ton of holes filled with
    empty values (nil).  This would be very poor for speed and memory allocation.
