Three collision strategies not mention in checkpoint:

1.  Robin Hood - a variation of double-hashing collision resolution with the idea that a new key may displace a key already inserted, if it's probe count is larger than that of the key at the current position. Robin Hood hashing reduces worst case search times in the table.
2.  Hopscotch - an alternative open-addressing solution which combines cuckoo hashing and linear probing while avoiding many of their limitations
3.  Coalasced - a hybrid of chaining and open addressing where chains of nodes are linked together within the table itself

My Collision Resolution Strategy

  - Hash values created based on - ASCII value X current array size
  - Upon collision I would first check the load factor, if > .7 call resize and insert new items
  - If load factor < .7, find next open spot for new item causing collision
