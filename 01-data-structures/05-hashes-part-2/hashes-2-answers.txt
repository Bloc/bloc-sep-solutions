1. Describe three collision resolution strategies not mentioned here.
2. Create your own collision resolution strategy and describe how it works.

1.) 
    1 Random hashing like double hashing will avoid clustering
    because probing is dependent upon the key. With random hashing
    the probe sequence is generated by the output of a pseudorandom  
    number generator. This is often not used over the double-hash 
    thought because of the expense of random number generation.

    2. Coalesced hashing is a hybrid of chaining and open addressing.
    It links together chains of nodes within the table, like open addressing 
    it has memory and cache usage advantages over chaining. But like
    chaining it does not have clustering effects. The table can be filled 
    to a high density but cannot have more elements than table slots. 

    3. 2-choice Hashing involves two hash functions for the table.
    Both hash functions will compute two table locations it will
    then pick the table with fewer objects in it to place the new object.


2.) Like the cuckoo hashing you could calculate two hash locations but also combine
2-choice hashing so you have two hash functions for two locations.
