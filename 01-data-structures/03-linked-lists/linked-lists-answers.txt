1. What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?
This is when the processor retrieves a range of adjacent locations, as opposed
to just the requested location, when accessing RAM and stores these locations
to cache. In doing so, this means that these locations can be retrieved
inexpensively from cache instead of expensively from RAM. 

2. Compare the performance of an Array to a Linked List using the Benchmark module.
 - Compare the time it takes to create a 10,000 item Array to appending 10,000 items
    to a Linked List.
    
	It takes 0.000013 seconds to create the array and 0.005404 to create the linked list.
 
 - Compare the time it takes to access the 5000th element of the Array and the
   5000th Node in the Linked List.
	
	It took 0.000005 seconds for the array and 0.000469 for the linked list.

 - Compare the time it takes to remove the 5000th element from the Array to removing the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
	
	It took 0.000009 to delete from the array and 0.000010 to delete from the linked list.
