  Spacial Locality involves accessing items that are close together in memory, as
in an array.  This benefits performance as it limits the number of RAM lookups which
are more time consuming.

  I have created the benchmark tests for the array and the linked list.  I found
array out performed the linked list in all 3 tests.  When creating the 10,000 item
array and appending 10,000 items to the linked list the array completed slightly
more then 4 seconds before the linked list.  The list had to move through all previous
nodes to add to the tail node, explaining why it took so much longer.  Accessing
the 5,000th element and deleting the 5,000 element were much closer as far as time
but the array was still faster in both tests.

    I have attached links to my benchmark tests on repl.it.
