1.  Data with spatial locality are close together in terms of where they are
    stored inside of memory. Looking up items that have spatial locality is
    faster because the data you are searching for very likely exists in that
    specific range.

2.  Each pair of times represents the time it took for a linked list operation
    followed by an array operation. Array operations took a lot less time to
    complete than any linked list operation.

(  0.001305) - Appending 10000 nodes of the string "testing" to the linked list
(  0.000040) - Creating an Array object with 10k items, all have the arbitrary
               integer value of 3242

(  0.000004) - Time it took to traverse the entirety of the linked list with a
               while loop
(  0.000002) - Time for the call arr[4999] to be completed

(  0.000005) - Time for remove_tail method to complete
(  0.000003) - Time for delete_at[4999] to complete
