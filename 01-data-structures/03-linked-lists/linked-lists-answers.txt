1.) What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?
  Spatial locality describes how data takes up physical space in memory. When
  data is stored sequentially, cache is more likely to get all of the data
  needed for a given operation. When a data structure stores its data in
  several unpredictable locations, it's easier for cache to have a cache miss.
  The processor then has to look in other slower memory hardware, negatively
  affecting performance.

Compare the performance of an Array to a Linked List using the Benchmark
module.

2.) Compare the time it takes to create a 10,000 item Array to appending 10,000
items to a Linked List.
  Array measured times for creating 10,000 item array
    0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000010)
  Linked lists measured times for appending 10,000 nodes to the list
    1.710000   0.010000   1.720000 (  1.708442)

3.) Compare the time it takes to access the 5000th element of the Array and the
5000th Node in the Linked List.
  Times to find 5000th element in the array
    0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000005)
  Times to find the 5000th node on linked list
    0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000134)

4.) Compare the time it takes to remove the 5000th element from the Array to
removing the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
  Times to delete the 5000th element in the array
    0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000007)
  Times to delete the 5000th node in the linked list
    0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000392)
