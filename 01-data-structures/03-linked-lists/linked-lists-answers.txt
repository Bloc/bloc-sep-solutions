1. What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?
Answer:
When a memory location is accessed at a specific time it is likely that contiguous memory
locations will be accessed subsequently. Because array entries exist in consecutive memory
locations arrays are much more efficient to traverse which reduces the number of RAM
lookups.

2. Arrays are significantly faster than linked lists.
