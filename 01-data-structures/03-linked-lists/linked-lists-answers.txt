Q:What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?
  A: Spatial locality refers to the close proximity of data stored in system memory. 
  Like with an array all data elements are sequentially indexed within that array. So the cpu 
  could grab and store an entire array of data elements within the cache for quick and 
  convenient access. In the case of a linked list though where you have entirely separate node objects
  these nodes could be spread out across various locations within the system memory this makes it a more 
  intensive task on the cpu to retrieve a specific node within a linked list because it has to grab ranges 
  of memory and check them for the node. 
Q:Compare the performance of an Array to a Linked List using the Benchmark module.
  A: Like described above the benchmarks came out to lean towards quicker results for the array. 
                user     system      total        real
array push:     0.002001   0.000000   0.002001 (  0.002044)
array pop:      0.001740   0.000000   0.001740 (  0.001742)
ll_add_front:   0.002830   0.000000   0.002830 (  0.002832)
ll_delete:      0.002850   0.000000   0.002850 (  0.002852)
