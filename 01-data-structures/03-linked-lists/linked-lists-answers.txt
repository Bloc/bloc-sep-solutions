1. Spatial Locality is the process by which the computer, (when searching for a piece of data not present in the cache,) rather than retrieving a specific piece of data from the RAM, retrieves a range of data (memory locations.) The reason this benefits performance is because while it would seem inefficient to pull a larger amount of data and sort through it, the bottleneck in speed is actually retrieving data from RAM, and by grabbing larger partitions, it reduces the number of times the computer needs to take this action.
