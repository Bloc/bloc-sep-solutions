Line: I thought that the line one was pretty straight forward it was just a simple array
where everyone was in order in line, so trying to find someone would be relatively easy.
For this one I just used an array to keep track of where people are, when someone wants to leave
I found them using a query on the array finding if it contained the name of the person /
who wanted to get out of line. When someone wanted to get in line all it took is an
addition to the array which I used push, but using << could have worked too.

Pixel: This one I used a class to represent the pixel where dot notation would hold the
values of x, y, red, blue, and green.

Screen: This one was a bit tricky, but thanks to the Slack channel I was pushed in
the right direction. Simple enough I would make the key of the hash the x and y coordinates
via an array and then I would set the value to a pixel. Sounds easy in theory, but
I didn't think getting it to work would be that tricky, but I'll blame it on being
a bit rusty on Ruby coming from the Javascript course :)
