How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
  In the line.rb, screen.rb and the pixel.rb files, the subsequent classes contain accessors.
  These accessors (get and set) through the command 'attr_accessor' allow object properties
  to be read and set outside of the class. So that data structures created with this classes
  are able to be accessed and manipulated from outside the class.


If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
  Since the data structure is based on arrays, searching for an element is based on regular array functions.
  For example: object.index("match") or other array methods.

What other real-world data can each structure represent?

  In the line example, I think that an inventory control system would be a good example of this
  algorithm. A new product comes in, it goes to the back (as far as being aged) then the stock person
  can take any which one from stock.

  In the screen example, let's consider an application to manage a building. Where the matrix is
  is the actual building. The objects that get inserted into each "location (floor = x, room = y)" contain
  information about the occupant.
