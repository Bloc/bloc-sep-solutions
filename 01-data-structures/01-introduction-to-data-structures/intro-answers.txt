1) How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
  Line:
    The data structure is an array, which uses the index of the array for the order of the line. The front of the line is index[0] and the back is the last item in the array. New people are added to the end of the array. If people leave the line, then they are deleted from the array and the indices are shifted over one space.
  Screen:
    The data structure is a matrix (an array of an array). The width and height of the matrix is the x and y axis of the screen. A pixel is stored at the x and y point in the matrix.

2) If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
  Line:
    I would use the binary search method to match the persons name with the index (place in line).
  Screen:
    It can be retrieved with the x, y coordinates.

3) What other real-world data can this structure represent?
  Line:
    This data structure would work well for orders placed in a restaurant, phone calls in call waiting, or job request submissions. Basically, this structure is ideal for wherever a sequential list of things is processed on a first-in first-out basis.
  Screen:
    This data structure is ideal for 2-dimensional spatial mapping, maybe roadmaps, zipcodes, or floor layout maps.
