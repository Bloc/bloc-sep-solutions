1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate your data?

    For Line, the data is stored in an array, so that the person in the front of the line
    is at index[0] and the last person in line is at index[length-1].  You can push(<<)
    new people into the line or delete to remove them from the line.

    For Screen, the data is stored in a matrix, so that elements can be accessed by an x,y
    coordinate system.  The pixels themselves are stored as an object(hash) to keep a rgb
    color value and x,y coordinate.

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, 
    how would you search for it?

    For Line, there are methods available to find the first, last, or middle person in the
    line.

    For Screen, there is a method to search for an x,y coordinate to see if a pixel exists
    there.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

    For Line, this model can represent any data structure that would best be organized by an
    ordered list.

    For Pixel, this model could represent any object that would have multiple values
    associated with it.

    For Screen, this model could be used to represent any data structure that is best labeled
    and organized by coordinates.
