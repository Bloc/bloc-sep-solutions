# Intro Answers - answering these questions for line and screen data structures

1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?


# Line

1. Since this data structure is a line, it's best represented as an array.  You can manipulate the data with the methods below:
 a. join(person) - adds a person to the back of the line
 b. leave(person) - removes a person from the line (goes to get cotton candy)
 c. front - returns the person in the front of the line (at array[0]) who is about to get on the ride - you lucky person, you...
 d. middle - returns the person in the middle of the line (median)
 e. back - returns the person at the end of the line (must have just gotten in line)
 f. search(person) - looks for and returns if that person is in line (so moms can find their lost children who left to ride the roller coaster)

2. pretty clear from 1. above

3. I'd probably use this to determine lineup for an all-you-can-eat buffet
