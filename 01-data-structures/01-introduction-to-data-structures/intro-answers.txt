line:

1.  The line data structure allows developers to insert new members to the back of the line;
    remove members from any position in the queue while retaining the order of the members;
    obtain the positions of any members currently in the line.
   
2.  To find a specific element, one would iteratively search through the length of the line
    until a match is found

3.  This can be used to represent anything that requires a queue, such as lines at
    the DMV. It could also be used to keep track of perishable inventory. since insertion
    into this list happens from the end, we know that the first first items are always
    the oldest.
    
screen:

1.  The screen data structure allows developers to locate things on a 2d plane and
    insert values at those positions. It also gives you the value at any position
    on the plane
    
2.  It finds elements using given coordinates.

3.  This could be useful in representing a map as every object in the map would have
    its own coordinate and could easily be found.
