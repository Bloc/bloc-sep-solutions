1. Line of people at an amusement park

Overall, the line of people can best be represented by an array for the data structure. Some reasons are: 
A. We can represent the real world order of people in the order of the array elements.
B. We can mimic changes to the real world line accurately using array methods.
C. We are representing people with two pieces of data: a name and place in line that are adequately modeled by a string stored at a specific index.
D. We can assume that there are no ties in our line because it is a line for a ride where there is a 1:1 relationship between seats in the ride and line order.

Questions
1. Developers can manipulate the data structure with common array operations such as using the array[index] method to read and write/update data.
2. You can either use the #[] method to find an element by index, or array.index('string') to find the index of a given element.
3. This structure is useful for representing a list of unique items ordered along a single dimension where the order matters in storing and searching. Examples include lists of items ordered by priority (such as a to-do list or shopping list), step-by-step instructions (such as navigation, cooking or furniture assembly instructions), force-rankings (no ties allowed) (i.e. my ranked order of favorite things to eat, stars by size), chronological ordering (ex. ordered list of names of Presidents of the United States).
