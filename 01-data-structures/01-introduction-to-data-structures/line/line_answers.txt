Q: How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
A: Developers can add, remove and search members which utilizes the push, slice
and also checks to see if the person searched for exists, if it does, it returns the value.
They can also see who is first and last using the standard .first and .last methods.
They can then take the total number of objects and divide by two, and round 

Q: If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure,
how would you search for it?
A: The developer would need to make sure they include the current list of members,
and search by member name and not allow a an empty search.

Q: What other real-world data can each structure represent?
A: Customers in any given setting where people come and go.

Race cars entering and leaving the pits if you are counting first and last by time
entered into pits and not physical spot I think. (This would not include the ever
changing order of the cars during the race time on the track).
