members is an array, and people is elemnet of the array.

join method is to add element into an array. Using push command can achieve that.

leave method is to remove an element. Method delete can do that.

front method is to show the first person of the array. Simply array[0] will do.

middle method is to show the middle person of the array. The length of array divid by 2 is the answer.

back method is to show the last person of the array which is length of array minus 1.

search method is to search the person. Using each method of array to search every element of array. If matches then return, if no then return nil.

I'm not sure where can I utilize the index private method, but I think it's to get the index of the person, so I use each_with_index method of array to implement it.
