1. My data structure allows a developer to add more individuals to a line, but does not allow them to manipulate the position of anyone added to the line. 
My data structure allows a developer to access the data in several different ways. They can see who is at the front, middle and back of the line, they 
can search for a specific person to find their position in the line, and they can search to see if a specific person is in line. Developers 
can also remove individuals from the line.

2. I would search for the element by name (the name of the individual who we are searching for).

3. This data structure can be used to represent any type of data that involves a line (assembly line,
line at a movie theatre etc.).
