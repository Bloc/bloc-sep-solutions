1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

Developer will only be able to add elements to the back of the queue and can remove the element from any position.
They can also retrieve the element that exists at multiple locations and also search for a particular person.

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

A for loop is used to go through each index of the queue to find if a specific element exists. If the
element exists, it will return that person, otherwise will return nil.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?
Can be used for any structure relating to people standing in single file lines, such as in the DMV or
 a single traffic lane
