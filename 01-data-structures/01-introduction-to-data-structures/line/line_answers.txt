**Explanations on my answer**

- Since this assignment deals with a single file line, `Array` seems to be the best data structure to use. Also, the `initialize` method was already there by default.

- Most of the methods are using basic `Ruby` methods, and they are very straightforward.

- Notes on the `middle` method: I implemented this method according to how the RSpec was setup, but if what "middle" means changes, my method needs to change.

  For example, if we had an array of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], according to the way the given RSpec defines where the "middle" is, `3` is the middle.

  But you could define "middle" as `2, 3` when there is an even number of elements in an array like the above array. Under that definition, the `middle` method has to first check if the array's length is even or odd. Then execute code to determine which element or elements are in the "middle".

  For the purpose of this exercise, my code passes the given test for the method.
