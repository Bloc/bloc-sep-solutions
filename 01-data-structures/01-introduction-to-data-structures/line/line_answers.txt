1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the
data?
  The name strings are stored in an array. The array can be obtained through the
  correct instance variable. Data can added or removed via instance methods. The
  place in line of a given name is the index of that name in the data array.

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how
would you search for it?
  There is an instance method "search(name)" that returns nil if the name is
  not found. Alternatively, it returns the name if the name is found in the
  array.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?
  A live manufacturing process.
