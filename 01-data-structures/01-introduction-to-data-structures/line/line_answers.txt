1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

The line data structure has a number of methods allowing a developer to access
and manipulate the data. The front, middle and back methods allow the developer
to access the person at the front, middle or back of the line. The join method
allows the developer to add a new person to the back of the line and the leave
method allows the developer to remove any person in the line.

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in the data, they would use
the search method. The search method takes in a persons name and returns the
index that they are located at.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

Any data where a first-in-first-out data structure is required would be suitable
for a data structure similar to the line. For example, financial transactions,
where there may be some delay for the transaction to complete and several
transactions are being requested at once. The transactions can be queued to
the end of the line while they wait to be processed, and if someone decides
to cancel their transaction before it is processed they can remove it from
the line.
