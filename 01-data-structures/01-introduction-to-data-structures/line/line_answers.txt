  For this challenge regarding the line at an amusement park I opted to use an
array as the data structure.  I came to this decision as an array is already much
like a line.

  You can easily add "people" to the end of the "line" using the array.push
method, similar to people joining a real world line at the end.  An array of
is also linear like a line, and using some basic ruby method you can modify the
array to show people leaving and entering the line in addition to seeing who is
first, last and in the middle.

  Developers would be able to access and manipulate this data by using Ruby array
method in addition to searching by index.  Developers could also search by name
using the detect method Ruby provides.

  I believe that an array was the right solution.  I can also envision arrays
being a useful data structure for other situations such as a to-do list of items,
or the midi values and their related notes on a piano.  Some other examples that
come to mind would be a repair queue at a phone shop, storing high scores on
sequential levels of an arcade game, etc.  The list could go on and on as there
is much real-world data that an array could represent.

  While arrays are a more straight forward and simple data structure their use
and ability to represent data is very valuable to developers.
