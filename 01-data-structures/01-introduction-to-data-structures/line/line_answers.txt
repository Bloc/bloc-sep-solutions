(really not sure about how I should be answering these questions…I’ve always been bad with this part)

1.How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
	There is the function join which adds data to the end of the structure, or leave which removes a specific piece of data from said structure. It also provides functions to check the front, middle, and end positions of the data.  


2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
	The search function I guess? It allows you to search by a specific string and returns the name if the result exists (this functionality doesn’t seem particularly useful, but it’s how the skeleton of the code and the tests were laid out.)



3.What other real-world data can each structure represent?
	Pretty much anything which keeps track of an ordered (sorta) list of strings. There are endless examples of cues and lists, but they are all functionally speaking “lines.”
