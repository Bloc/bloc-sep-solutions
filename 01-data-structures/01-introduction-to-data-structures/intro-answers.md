The Line, is a simple array wrapped in a class with helper methods to ensure that the oldest user is at the front and the newest at the back. You can use `join(person)`, `leave(person)`, `front`, `middle`, `back`, and `search(person)` to access data. If you wanted to find someone specific you could use `search` by calling `search(string)` to locate that person which will return a string or nil based on it's existance. You could also use this data structure to hold queues other than people and improve upon it by having a hash table for each time to hold data with the key being a name in this case or perhaps an ID. You could also use that same principle for just about any type of inventory item.

The Screen, is a 2D array matrix which is `0..n` on the `x` or `y` axis. If you search for `screen.at(1,1)` with a pixel existing there it will return a `Pixel` object containing RBG and an X,Y cordinate. You can also use `insert(pixel, x, y)` to insert pixels into the screen. You could use this data structure for GIS information to plot interesting data on a coordinate point, however, you would need to have 4 seperate matrixes to represent the lat and long changes because this method uses the index of the `x` and `y` arrays to pin point a coordiante. You could also use this as a 3D chart by placing the object nested in a `Hash` while using the key as a `z` plot point.
