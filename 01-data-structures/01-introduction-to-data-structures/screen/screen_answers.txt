1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the
data?
  The data is stored in an array of arrays. The "outer" array is made up of
  "row" arrays. And, each of the elements of the "row" arrays represent a
  column. So, the array is accessed as: "matrix_array[row_index][column_index]".
insert pixel: instance method

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how
would you search for it?
  An element with specific "x" and "y" coordinates can be found by using the
  "at(x,y)" instance method.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?
  a. The pixels on a digital picture.
  b. The grid of a webpage
  c. The grid of a map (e.g. google maps!)
