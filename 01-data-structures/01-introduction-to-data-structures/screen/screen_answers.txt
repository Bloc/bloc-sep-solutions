How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

  * It breaks it down into sections that are easy to understand and manage.  Allowing Pixels to be of a different class,
  developers do not have to manage Screen if only wanting to manipulate Pixel data.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

  * Could find what they are looking for by searching a specific coordinate.  If it's not there, it should tell
  them its unavailable.

What other real-world data can each structure represent?

  * The screen and pixels can represent many graphical data structures by storing data within each coordinate.
