1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

Developers can access the data with using methods to retrieve the data at each pixel
of the screen.  The developer can create a new pixel object with the chosen color and user the insert
method to enter the pixel into the matrix.

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

A nested for loop can be used to find the value matching the x value and then find the y value through the
second loop.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

The data structure can be used to represent different locations on a map or rooms of
a floor of a hotel (any building)
