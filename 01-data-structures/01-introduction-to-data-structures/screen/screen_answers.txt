The trickiest part was figuring out how to build the @matrix attribute.  I looked up a number of different methods
Intuitively I wanted to use ruby's Matrix method, but you have to install and include that, so it took me a while to figure out how to build the array w/o it.
Once I got that figured it I just need to set up some conditions via the inbounds private method and assign pixels to values in the matrix
