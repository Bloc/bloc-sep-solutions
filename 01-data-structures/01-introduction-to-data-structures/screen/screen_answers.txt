  For this challenge regarding the pixel and screen I opted to use a matrix made
up of an array containing arrays.  This allowed me to represent the height and
width of the screen that will then contain the pixels.

  This data structure will allow for easy access to the data in the matrix.  By
using matrix[coordinate-x][coordinate-y] you can easily manipulate or retrieve the data in the structure.  Developers
would be able to easily search for pixels by coordinates.

  This data structure could be useful for other real world data representations
such as any game that utilizes a grid, for example battleship, connect 4 or 
tick tack toe.  In addition previous checkpoints showed that a matrix can be used
to represent graph data such as vertices and edges.
