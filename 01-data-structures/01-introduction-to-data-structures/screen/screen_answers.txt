(really not sure about how I should be answering these questions…I’ve always been bad with this part) 

1.How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
	There is functionality to create pixels with data about their r/g/b color values, as well as to position said pixels to different spots on a screen (matrix,) which they can also define the boundaries of when creating.


2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
	This allows them to search for specific pixels (returning the data about pixel’s color value,) by entering specific coordinates. 


3.What other real-world data can each structure represent?
	It would work as any number of grid-type structures. A simple example (which wouldn’t require the complexity of the pixel class,) would be say the position of letters on a scrabble board, a word search, (or as a more complicated case) imagining types of information (boxes, letters, etc.) on a grid to create a crossword puzzle. A more appropriate example might be to imagine the pixels as students in a large classroom, the color values as details about said student, and the screen/grid as a layout of desks or seats.
