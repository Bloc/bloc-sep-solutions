1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

The screen data structure has insert and at methods to access and manipulate
data. The insert method inserts a pixel at the specified coordinates on the
screen. The at method displays the pixel at the specified coordinates.

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

The developer would us the at method to search for a specified element. The at
method takes in x and y coordinates of the element, and returns the information
for the pixel at location.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

The multi-dimensional array can be used to store data with multiple attributes,
similar to the use of objects. An example could be the use of a
multi-dimensional array to store user information as an array of arrays.
Another example is the use of multi-dimensional arrays to represent information
to be displayed in a table.
