1. The heap takes MUCH MUCH longer. (Obviously my heap is also extra inefficient) 
2. I note the find takes longer for the heap, but this is probably in some part due to my programs issues. 
3. See above (same situation as find for delete.) 
4. The tree is often faster. It certainly is in terms of insertion (I think) or deletion as well as for searching for arbitrary elements. 
5. The heap (aside from offering a more robust/complete ordering) is also very good at locating a min/max. Itâ€™s also better for creating priority queues.
