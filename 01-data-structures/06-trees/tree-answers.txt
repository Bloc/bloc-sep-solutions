When would you use a Binary Search Tree and why?

If organization of data is not important, binary search trees are quicker then hash tables etc.  The size of the tree is
only composed of the needed space needed to incorporate into the tree.  Insertion is faster because it goes to the bottom most
insertion area.

When would you use an Heap and why?

You'd use a heap when organizing data is essential.  For example, when people want "price high to low" on amazon.com, all the data
to display to the user could use a max-heap to display the content.
