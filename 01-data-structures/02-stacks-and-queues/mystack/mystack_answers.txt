  With my current understanding of a stack I believe my solution meets the necessary
requirements.

  For my push method I appended the item to the end of the stack.  From there my
pop method will temporarily store the current top then delete the last element
in the array.  It will then reset the top to the new last element and return
the old top.

  The empty? method will check to see if the array length is equal to zero and
if it is it means the stack is empty and will return true.  If the length is not
equal to zero then that will mean there is at least one element in the array
and will return false.
