  I have created a queue and based on the tests, in addition to my understanding
I believe it has what is necessary to function properly as a queue.

  My enqueue method appends the element to the end of the array.  It will then
set the new head as the element at queue[0] and the tail as element at queue[-1].

  My dequeue method allows for FIFO as it will remove the first item in the queue
after storing it temporarily(so that it can be returned).  Following the removal of
the first element it will set the new head to the new item at queue[0] and the new
tail to queue[-1].  It will then return the previous head.

  My empty method will check to see if the queue length is equal to zero and if
it is we know the queue is empty and the method will return true.  If not equal
to zero then the method will return false as it is not empty
