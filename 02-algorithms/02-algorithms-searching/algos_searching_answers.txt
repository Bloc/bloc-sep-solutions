1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

  It would take 7 iterations using a linear search since it is the seventh item in the array.

2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

  It would take 3 iterations using binary search. On the second iteration, low, mid, and high would be set to "G" instead of "E".

3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.

fib(10) = fib(9) + fib(8)
           34    +   21
                55

fib(11) = fib(10) + fib(9)
            55    +   34
                 89

fib(12) = fib(11) + fib(10)
            89    +    55
                 144
