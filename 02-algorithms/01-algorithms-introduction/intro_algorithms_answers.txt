Using proper pseudo-code, describe three or more primitive algorithms used in your day-to-day life.

  * Making-Coffee Algorithm
    1. boil water
    2. put cone on top of the coffee pot
    3. put filter in the cone
    4. put 3 tablespoons of coffee in the filter
    5. when water boils, put in carafe and wait one minute
    6. cover carafe and pour a little water into the cone
    7. empty coffee pot
    8. pour cone full of water
    9. repeat two more times until pot is full
    10. enjoy!

  * Brushing-Teeth Algorithm
    1. wet toothbrush head
    2. put dab of toothpaste on head
    3. turn on brush
    4. brush each area for 30 seconds
    5. turn off brush
    6. rinse off brush head
    7. rinse out mouth
    8. smile

  * Grading-Homework Algorithm
    1. gather papers together
    2. loop through papers until there are no more
      a. read paper
      b. if there is a mistake and you understand, correct it
      c. if there is a mistake and you don't understand, underline with a question mark
      d. grade full, half, or zero for effort
    3. if there are common mistakes (4 or more students), then note for discussion
    4. record grade for each homework(loop)
    5. rest
