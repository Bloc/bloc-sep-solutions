1) An algorithm that has O(1) is a similar to a Bugatti Veyron and an algorithm that has O(2^n) is similar to a Volvo.
2) The best case scenario for binary search is when the element is in the middle of the collection.
3) The worst case scenario for binary search is when the element is not in the collection at all. 
4) The bounded-case scenario for binary search is when the element is anywhere besides the middle of the collection.
5) (See Graph)
6) As the number of items in the collection approaches infinity, the asymptotic limit is infinity.
7) O(2^n)
