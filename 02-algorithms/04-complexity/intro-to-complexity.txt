1. The algorithm with O(1) is private jet, on its way to China.
The O(2n) would be me walking and swimming to get to the same destination, except I don't think I'd make it.

2. Best case scenario for binary search would be if the thing it was searching for was the first thing it came across.

3. Worst case scenario is the slowest and the last place the search finds. Worst case could also get worse if the data is not sorted.

4. Bounded case is when you get the average of the worst case and the best case.

6. There really isn't an asymptote but the graph is logarithmic.

7. 0log(n)

8.def linear_search(array, value)
  input_size = 0
  array.each_with_index do |i|
    input_size += 1
    if array[i] == value
      return "Iterations: #{i + 1} Input size: #{input_size}"
    end
  end
end

10. Big-O is 0log(n)

11. Big-Omega is 0(1)

12. Big-Theta is 0log(n)
