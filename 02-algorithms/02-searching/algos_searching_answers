1) It would take 7 iterations to find the value G using linear search.

2) It would take 3 iterations to find the value G using binary search.

3) fib(10) = 55 | fib(11) = 89 | fib(12) = 144

1) For an unsorted collection of items, I would use linear search with an iterative solution because binary search only works for sorted collections.

2) For a sorted collection of items, I would use binary search with an iterative solution as it seems to be much faster than a recursive solution.
