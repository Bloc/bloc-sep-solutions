Psuedocode and SQL queries for Checkpoint 1: Databases:Introduction

1. Remove duplicates in a query response

  (PSUEDO)
    comments = Comment.all
    user_ids = ARRAY
    FOR user_id IN comments DO
      IF user_ids DOES NOT INCLUDE user_id THEN
        user_ids << user_id
      END IF
    END FOR LOOP

  (SQL)
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id
      FROM comment;

2. Filter records using inequalities, pattern matching, ranges, and boolean logic

  (PSUEDO)
    comments = Comment.all
    comments123 = ARRAY
    FOR index IN (0 TO comments.length - 1) DO
      post_id = comments[index]
      IF post_id >= 1 AND post_id <= 3 THEN
        comments123 << comments[index]
      END IF
    END FOR LOOP

  (SQL)
    SELECT *
      FROM comment
      WHERE post_id BETWEEN 1 AND 3;

3. Sort records in a particular order

  (PSUEDO)
    users = User.all
    sorted_users = SORT users BY user.full_name

  (SQL)
    SELECT *
      FROM user
      ORDER BY full_name DESC;

4. Limit the number of records returned

  (PSUEDO)
    posts = Post.all
    lyrics = ARRAY
    FOR index IN 0 TO 1 DO
      lyrics << posts[index].body
    END FOR

  (SQL)
    SELECT body
      FROM post
      LIMIT 2;

5. Group records into sections

  (PSUEDO)
    comments = Comment.all
    comments_grouped = ARRAY
    FOR index IN 0 TO comments.length - 1 DO
      post = comments[index].post_id
      comments_grouped[post] = comments[index].body
    END FOR

  (SQL)
    SELECT post_id, body
      FROM comment
      GROUP BY post_id;

6. Perform calculations using aggregate functions

  (PSUEDO)
    comments = Comment.all
    posts_count = ARRAY
    FOR index IN 0 TO comments.length - 1 DO
      post = comments[index].post_id
      posts_count[post] INCREMENT BY 1
    END FOR LOOP

  (SQL)
    SELECT post_id, COUNT(post_id)
      FROM comment
      GROUP BY post_id;

7. Join tables using cross join, inner join, and outer join

  (PSUEDO)
    posts = Post.all
    users = User.all
    singers_titles = ARRAY
    FOR i IN 0 TO posts.length - 1 DO
      FOR j IN 0 TO users.length - 1 DO
        singers_titles << (users[j].full_name + ", " + posts[i].title)
      END FOR LOOP
    END FOR LOOP

  (SQL)
    SELECT user.full_name, post.title
      FROM user
      CROSS JOIN post;
