1.  An algorithm that has O(1) is a Ferrari and an algorithm that has an O(2^n) is a bicycle.
2.  Best case scenario for binary search would be when the value searching for is the middle value
    in the initial array, this would be returned on the first iteration.
3.  Worst case scenario for binary search would be when the value searching for is either the first
    or last value in the array.
4.  Bounded-case scenario for binary search would be when the value searching for is closest to or at the middle
    for each search iteration
5.  See screenshot - 5_graphed_data.png
6.  Infinity
7.  O(2^n)
8.  See input_to_iterations_linear.rb
9.  See screenshot - Big-O is O(n) - 9_graphed_data.png
10. Big-O of binary search is O(n)
11. Big-Ω of binary search is O(1)
12. Big-Ө of binary search is O(log n)
